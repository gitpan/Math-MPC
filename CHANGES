0.60
 - Requires version 0.60 of the mpc library.
 - Now a complete range of Rmpc_set_*_* functions (where '*' can be any
   one of 'ui', 'si', 'd', 'uj', 'sj', 'ld', 'f', 'q', 'z' and 'fr').
 - Add Rmpc_set_z, Rmpc_set_q, Rmpc_set_f and Rmpc_set_fr.
 - Add Rmpc_set_z_z, Rmpc_set_q_q and Rmpc_set_f_f.
 - In keeping with changes to the mpc library, all of the Rmpc_init*
   functions have been removed except for Rmpc_init2 and Rmpc_init3
   (and their "_nobless" forms).
 - mpc-0.60 has removed mpc_get_default_prec and mpc_set_default_prec.
   Rmpc_get_default_prec and Rmpc_set_default_prec remain (but the
   former has changed to return 0 if default real and imaginary
   precisions are different. With earlier versions, real and imaginary
   default precisions were always the same, but this is no longer the
   case). Rmpc_get_default_prec2 and Rmpc_set_default_prec2 have now
   been added. The former returns an array of 2 values(real,
   imaginary) and the latter requires 2 arguments (real, imaginary).
 - The overload_copy sub now preserves the precision of the copied object
   (instead of assigning default precision as was previously the case).
 - Rmpc_get_str now wraps mpc_get_str (available in 0.6). The (pure perl)
   sub that was formerly "Rmpc_get_str" has been renamed "_get_str".
   The "overload_string" sub is unchanged.
 - Add Rmpc_set_uj, Rmpc_set_sj and Rmpc_set_ld (available in mpc-0.6).
 - Add Rmpc_strtoc and Rmpc_set_str (available in 0.6), and add set_str.t
   test script.

0.52
 - Requires version 0.5.2 of the mpc library.
 - Add MPC_VERSION, MPC_VERSION_NUM and Rmpc_get_version.

0.51
 - Requires version 0.5.1 of the mpc library.
 - Add MPC_VERSION_STRING, MPC_VERSION_MAJOR, MPC_VERSION_MINOR
   and MPC_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL.
 - Replace pre-existing Rmpc_set_fr_fr with a function that wraps
   the mpc_set_fr_fr function (which became available in 0.5.1)
 - Add Rmpc_real, Rmpc_imag, Rmpc_arg, Rmpc_proj (new in 0.5.1)

0.50
 - Requires version 0.50 of the mpc library.
 - Add Rmpc_log, Rmpc_cos, Rmpc_tan, Rmpc_sinh, Rmpc_cosh, and
   Rmpc_tanh - all of which became available with mpc-0.5.
 - Add log and cos overloading.
 - Remove (the need for) INLINE.h
 - Add mpfr_v and gmp_v functions (not exported).
 - mpc_out_str changed with mpc-0.5. The tests in out_str1.t and
   out_str2.t were changed accordingly.
 - Bring Rmpc_get_str in line with the changed formatting of 
   mpc_out_str that occurred with mpc-0.5.

0.46
 - Add overloading of 'bool'.
 - Change Rmpc_out_str and Rmpc_inp_str to allow use of streams other 
   than STDOUT and STDIN.
 - For compatibility with my other MPFR/GMP based perl modules, add
   TRmpc_out_str and TRmpc_inp_str (which, for Math::MPC only, are 
   aliased to Rmpc_out_str and Rmpc_inp_str respectively).
 - Change 'Rmpc_get_prec' return to match 'mpc_get_prec' (which is a new
   inclusion in mpc-0.4.6).
 - Add 'Rmpc_get_prec2' and 'Rmpc_sin' (new in mpc-0.4.6).
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler, GMP library, MPFR library and MPC library.
