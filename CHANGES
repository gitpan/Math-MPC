0.51
 - Requires version 0.5.1 of the mpc library.
 - Add MPC_VERSION_STRING, MPC_VERSION_MAJOR, MPC_VERSION_MINOR
   and MPC_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL.
 - Replace pre-existing Rmpc_set_fr_fr with a function that wraps
   the mpc_set_fr_fr function (which became available in 0.5.1)
 - Add Rmpc_real, Rmpc_imag, Rmpc_arg, Rmpc_proj (new in 0.5.1)

0.50
 - Requires version 0.50 of the mpc library.
 - Add Rmpc_log, Rmpc_cos, Rmpc_tan, Rmpc_sinh, Rmpc_cosh, and
   Rmpc_tanh - all of which became available with mpc-0.5.
 - Add log and cos overloading.
 - Remove (the need for) INLINE.h
 - Add mpfr_v and gmp_v functions (not exported).
 - mpc_out_str changed with mpc-0.5. The tests in out_str1.t and
   out_str2.t were changed accordingly.
 - Bring Rmpc_get_str in line with the changed formatting of 
   mpc_out_str that occurred with mpc-0.5.

0.46
 - Add overloading of 'bool'.
 - Change Rmpc_out_str and Rmpc_inp_str to allow use of streams other 
   than STDOUT and STDIN.
 - For compatibility with my other MPFR/GMP based perl modules, add
   TRmpc_out_str and TRmpc_inp_str (which, for Math::MPC only, are 
   aliased to Rmpc_out_str and Rmpc_inp_str respectively).
 - Change 'Rmpc_get_prec' return to match 'mpc_get_prec' (which is a new
   inclusion in mpc-0.4.6).
 - Add 'Rmpc_get_prec2' and 'Rmpc_sin' (new in mpc-0.4.6).
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler, GMP library, MPFR library and MPC library.
