 - Add overloading of 'bool'.
 - Change Rmpc_out_str and Rmpc_inp_str to allow use of streams other 
   than STDOUT and STDIN.
 - For compatibility with my other MPFR/GMP based perl modules, add
   TRmpc_out_str and TRmpc_inp_str (which, for Math::MPC only, are 
   aliased to Rmpc_out_str and Rmpc_inp_str respectively).
 - Change 'Rmpc_get_prec' return to match 'mpc_get_prec' (which is a new
   inclusion in mpc-0.4.6).
 - Add 'Rmpc_get_prec2' and 'Rmpc_sin' (new in mpc-0.4.6).
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler, GMP library, MPFR library and MPC library.
