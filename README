This module wraps the MPC library functions.

The MPC library is a C library for multiple-precision complex number
computations with exact rounding. It is based on the MPFR C library 
which, in turn, is based on the GMP C library.

MPC, like MPFR and GMP, is free. It is distributed under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU Lesser GPL).

Because this module wraps the MPC functions, it requires that the
MPC library (version 0.5 or later), the GMP library (version 4.2.0
or later) and the MPFR library (version 2.3.0 or later) have been
installed. 

For the GMP library see:
http://swox.com/gmp

For the MPFR library see:
http://www.mpfr.org
Do not use the (outdated) MPFR library source that ships with the
GMP source.

For the MPC library see:
http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/

You'll also need to have Math::MPFR (version 2.01 or later) installed.

To build this module you need perl 5.6.0 or later. I'm not sure of all
the requirements to get it to build with earlier versions of perl, but
it's definite that the XS code relating to operator overloading will
not compile with perl versions prior to 5.6.

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

When building this module, the MPC, GMP and MPFR libraries will need to be
accessible. If those files are in a location where your compiler does 
not find them by default, then instead of running 'perl Makefile.PL', 
you'll need to run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-I/path/to/gmp_includes -I/path/to/mpfr_includes -I/path/to/mpc/include"
 LIBS="-L/path/to/mpc_lib -lmpc -L/path/to/mpfr_lib -lmpfr -L/path/to/gmp_lib -lgmp"

==============
64-bit support
==============

If your perl's Config reports that 'use64bitint' is defined, or that
'use64bitall' is defined, or that 'usemorebits' is defined, or that
'ivsize' is 8, then Math::MPC will, by default, be built with access
to the mpfr_*_uj and mpfr_*_sj functions. Else, access to those 
functions is, by default, denied. You can override the default by 
opening up the Makefile.PL and uncommenting the appropriate line (just
a few lines down from the top of the file ... the comments in that
file should make it clear).

Similarly, if your perl's Config reports that 'uselongdouble' is 
defined, or that 'usemorebits' is defined, or that 'longdblsize' ==
'doublesize', then Math::MPC will, by default, be built with access
to the mpfr_*_ld functions. Else, access to those functions is, 
by default, denied. You can override the default by opening up the 
Makefile.PL and uncommenting the appropriate line (just a few lines down
from the top of the file ... the comments in that file should make it
clear).

I believe it to be both unnecessary and inadvisable to override the 
default - but if you do find that you need to override the default, 
please let me know. That you have found it necessary to override the
default is something I probably ought to know about.

I am contactable by email at sisyphus at(@) cpan dot (.) org.

==========
MS WINDOWS
==========
If building with an MSVC++ compiler against MinGW-built mpc, gmp and mpfr
libs, you'll need to additionally link to MinGW's libgcc.a and libcoldname.a.
First, create copies of the 5 '.a' files (named libmpc.lib, libgmp.lib,
libmpfr.lib, libgcc.lib, libcoldname.lib) and then run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-IC:/path/to/gmp_includes -I/path/to/mpfr_includes -IC:/path/to/mpc_include"
    LIBS="-LC:/path/to/mpc_lib -lmpc -LC:/path/to/gcc_lib -lgcc -LC:/path/to/coldname_lib -lcoldname
    -LC:/path/to/mpfr_lib -lmpfr -LC:/path/to/gmp_lib -lgmp"
